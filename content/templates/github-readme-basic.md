## The Problem

[2-3 sentences describing the real-world problem this project addresses. Be specific about who experiences this problem and why existing solutions don't work.]

Example:
> Students at my high school were missing scholarship opportunities because there's no easy way to search hundreds of scholarships by specific eligibility criteria. Existing scholarship search engines require filling out lengthy forms and often return irrelevant results.

## The Solution

[2-3 sentences explaining what you built and how it works from a user's perspective. Avoid technical jargon—explain it like you would to someone who doesn't work in tech.]

Example:
> I built a conversational scholarship finder that students can talk to in plain English. Instead of filling out forms, they describe themselves ("I'm a first-gen student interested in engineering") and get personalized scholarship recommendations instantly.
