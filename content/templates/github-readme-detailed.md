## 🎯 The Problem

### Who is affected?
[Describe the specific group of people who experience this problem]

### What's the pain point?
[Explain the problem in concrete, relatable terms]

### Why do existing solutions fall short?
[Brief explanation of why this problem hasn't been solved well before]

**Example:**
> **Who:** First-generation college students at under-resourced high schools
>
> **Pain point:** These students are eligible for thousands of dollars in scholarships but don't know they exist. They don't have college counselors with time to help them search, and generic scholarship websites bury relevant opportunities under hundreds of irrelevant ones.
>
> **Why existing solutions fail:** Traditional scholarship databases require students to fill out lengthy profiles and still return mostly irrelevant results. The process is so tedious that many students give up.
