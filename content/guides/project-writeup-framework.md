# The AI Project Write-Up Framework

## How to Explain Your AI Projects So Anyone Gets It

Most students make the same mistake: they describe *what* they built technically, but forget to explain *why* it matters. Admissions officers and recruiters aren't evaluating your technical sophistication—they're evaluating your **problem-solving ability**, **initiative**, and **impact**.

This framework will help you present any AI project in a way that resonates with non-technical readers.

---

## The P-S-I Framework

Every project write-up should follow this structure:

### **P - Problem** (What was broken?)
- What real issue did you observe?
- Who was affected by this problem?
- Why did existing solutions fail or not exist?

### **S - Solution** (What did you build?)
- What did you create? (1-2 sentences, non-technical)
- How does it work from the user's perspective?
- What tools/platforms did you use?

### **I - Impact** (What changed?)
- How many people used it?
- What measurable outcomes resulted?
- What feedback did you receive?

---

## Example: Before and After

### ❌ BAD: Technical Description
> "I created a Custom GPT using OpenAI's GPT-5 API with a knowledge base of 500 scholarship listings scraped from various websites. The system uses RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to match user queries with relevant scholarships based on eligibility criteria."

**Why this fails:**
- Assumes reader knows what "Custom GPT," "RAG," and "API" mean
- Focuses on technical implementation, not human impact
- No mention of why this matters or who it helps

### ✅ GOOD: Impact-Focused Description
> **Problem:** Students at my school, especially first-generation college applicants, were missing scholarship opportunities because there's no easy way to search hundreds of scholarships by specific eligibility criteria like major, GPA, or background.
>
> **Solution:** I built a scholarship matching assistant that students can talk to in plain English. They describe themselves—"I'm a first-gen student interested in engineering with a 3.5 GPA"—and it instantly recommends relevant scholarships from a database of 500+ opportunities.
>
> **Impact:** 47 students at my school have used the tool. Three students found and won scholarships they wouldn't have discovered otherwise, totaling $12,000 in awards.

**Why this works:**
- Starts with a relatable human problem
- Explains the solution in everyday language
- Provides specific, quantifiable impact

## How to Find Your "Impact" When You Don't Have Metrics

Not every project will have "47 users" or "$12,000 in scholarships." Here's how to demonstrate impact even for smaller projects:

### If your project is new or has few users:

**Use qualitative feedback:**
> "After testing with 5 classmates, feedback indicated that the tool saved approximately 30 minutes per assignment compared to their previous workflow."

**Describe potential impact:**
> "If adopted school-wide, this tool could save students an estimated 200+ hours collectively during application season."

**Document the learning:**
> "Through this project, I learned to [specific skill] and identified that [insight about the problem], which I plan to address in version 2."

### If your project was for personal use:

**Frame it as a prototype or proof of concept:**
> "Built as a personal productivity experiment, this automation reduced my weekly email processing time from 2 hours to 20 minutes—a workflow I'm now documenting to share with other students."

### If your project "failed":

**Failures can be even more impressive if you show learning:**
> "Initial user testing revealed that students wanted [X] instead of [Y]. This taught me the importance of user research before building—a lesson I applied to my next project."

## The "So What?" Test

Before finalizing any project description, ask yourself:

1. **Could my grandmother understand what this does?** If not, simplify.
2. **Is it clear why someone would actually use this?** If not, strengthen the Problem section.
3. **Would a stranger believe this made a real difference?** If not, add specific details to Impact.
4. **Does this show I can identify and solve problems?** This is what admissions officers care about.

## 10 Real Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Research Tool

**Before:** "Created a literature review bot using Claude that summarizes academic papers."

**After:** "Struggling to read 30+ papers for my history research project, I built an AI assistant that summarizes academic papers and highlights key arguments. It cut my initial research phase from 2 weeks to 3 days, and I've shared the tool with 4 classmates working on their own research projects."

---

### Example 2: Community Project

**Before:** "Made a chatbot for my local food bank using GPT."

**After:** "Volunteers at my local food bank were spending 2+ hours per shift answering the same questions from visitors. I created a simple Q&A assistant that handles common questions about hours, eligibility, and available items. The food bank director estimates it's freed up 6+ volunteer hours per week."

---

### Example 3: Personal Productivity

**Before:** "Built an email automation with Zapier and ChatGPT."

**After:** "I was drowning in college-related emails—scholarship deadlines, application updates, campus visit confirmations. I built an automation that categorizes incoming emails, extracts deadlines, and adds them to my calendar automatically. What used to take 2 hours weekly now happens in the background."

---

### Example 4: School Project

**Before:** "Used AI to help with my science fair project on climate data."

**After:** "For my science fair project analyzing 50 years of local temperature data, I used AI to identify patterns and anomalies that would have taken weeks to spot manually. The approach earned recognition from judges specifically for 'innovative methodology,' and I've since helped two other students apply similar techniques to their projects."

---

### Example 5: Accessibility Tool

**Before:** "Created a tool to help my grandma use her phone."

**After:** "My grandmother wanted to video call family but found smartphone interfaces overwhelming. I set up a voice-activated assistant that lets her say 'Call Sarah' or 'Show me photos from Thanksgiving' without navigating menus. She now video calls weekly when before she'd given up entirely."

---

### Example 6: Content Creation

**Before:** "Used AI to help with my school newspaper."

**After:** "As editor of my school newspaper, I noticed we were losing readers because articles weren't promoted well on social media. I built a workflow that automatically generates social media posts from articles and schedules them optimally. Our Instagram engagement increased 40% in two months."

---

### Example 7: Study Aid

**Before:** "Made flashcards with AI."

**After:** "Preparing for AP exams across 4 subjects, I created a system that generates practice questions from my notes and tracks which concepts I'm weakest on. Using spaced repetition principles, it surfaces the right questions at the right time. I improved from 3s to 5s on all four exams."

---

### Example 8: Event Planning

**Before:** "Used ChatGPT to help plan school events."

**After:** "As student council president, I was overwhelmed coordinating prom logistics across 12 committees. I built a planning assistant that committee heads could query for budgets, deadlines, vendor contacts, and task assignments. It became our single source of truth and reduced my coordination time by 70%."

---

### Example 9: Language Learning

**Before:** "Made an AI tutor for Spanish practice."

**After:** "Standard language apps felt too scripted for real conversation practice. I created a conversation partner that adapts to my level, corrects grammar in context, and remembers our previous conversations. After 3 months of daily 15-minute sessions, I moved from 'Intermediate' to 'Advanced' on my school's placement test."

---

### Example 10: Research Assistance

**Before:** "Used Perplexity to do research faster."

**After:** "For my economics paper on local small business resilience, I needed to synthesize news articles, academic studies, and local government data. I built a research workflow using AI that processes sources, identifies contradictions, and generates citation-ready summaries. My teacher noted it was 'the most thoroughly researched student paper' she'd seen."

---

### ❌ Don't: Oversell small projects
> "Revolutionized how students find scholarships" (when 5 people used it)

### ✅ Do: Be honest about scale while still showing value
> "Tested with 5 students who reported saving 2+ hours each on their search"

---

### ❌ Don't: Focus only on yourself
> "I learned so much about AI and prompt engineering"

### ✅ Do: Center the people you helped
> "Students who used the tool reported feeling less overwhelmed by the scholarship process"
