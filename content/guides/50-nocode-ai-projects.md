## Important Notes on Presenting These Projects

1. **Don't oversell AI involvement.** Be clear that AI was a tool you used, not a replacement for your thinking.

2. **Emphasize the problem-solving.** The most impressive part isn't "I used GPT-5"—it's "I identified a problem and built a solution."

3. **Quantify impact when possible.** "Used by 47 students" beats "used by students at my school."

4. **Show iteration.** Mentioning that you improved your project based on feedback is impressive.

5. **Be honest about limitations.** Acknowledging what didn't work shows maturity.
