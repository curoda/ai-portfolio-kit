## FAQ

### "I don't know how to code—can I still use the portfolio templates?"

Yes! The templates are complete HTML files. You just need to:
1. Open in a text editor (or even Notepad)
2. Find and replace the bracketed text `[like this]` with your info
3. Save the file
4. Upload to Vercel/Netlify following the guide

You're editing text, not writing code.

### "Which portfolio template should I choose?"

- **Minimal:** If you want words to speak for themselves, applying to traditional schools
- **Modern:** If you want to look tech-savvy, applying to startup internships or CS programs
- **Academic:** If you're emphasizing research, applying to research programs or academic competitions

### "How many projects should I have?"

Quality over quantity. **2-3 excellent projects** beat 10 mediocre ones.

One deeply impactful project with great documentation > Five weekend experiments.

### "What if my project didn't get many users?"

That's okay! You can still show:
- Thoughtful problem identification
- Good execution
- Lessons learned
- Plans for improvement

See the "Finding Impact Without Metrics" section in `project-writeup-framework.md`.

### "Can I use AI to help write my portfolio content?"

Use AI to improve clarity and catch errors, but:
- Write the first draft yourself
- Keep your authentic voice
- Don't let AI inflate or oversell your work
- Be prepared to discuss everything in interviews

The AI is just how you got there. The impact is what matters.
